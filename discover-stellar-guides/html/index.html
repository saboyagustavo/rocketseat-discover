        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm Gustavo, a <em>millenial</em> art director and <s>digital sorcerer's</s>
            <strong>fullstack developer</strong> apprentice living in Goi√¢nia, Brazil. I like to spend my days
            alternating between taking care of my daughter (we are staying at home due to pandemic) and studying hard.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've opted to shift career in <date>2020</date> and I'm currently in my 1st year of code; before that I was
            working on cultural projects, like movies, theatre plays and opera. Always was a nerd, an outsider and also
            an alternative-music appreciator.
        </p>

        <h2>How I've learned to &lt;code&gt;</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>
            My development experience comes from courses (mostly free). So I learn from bootcamps, books, documentation
            and free content I find out there. <br />
            I'm always seeking to learn more.
        </p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>
            I've sailed on this ocean just a year ago, and then in the meantime, I've been working on several activities
            aiming to improve my skills.
