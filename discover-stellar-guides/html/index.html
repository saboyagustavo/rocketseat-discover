                <p>
                    I'm Gustavo, a <em>millenial</em> art director and <s>digital sorcerer's</s>
                    <strong>fullstack developer</strong> apprentice living in Goiânia, <abbr title="Brazil">BR</abbr>. I
                    like to spend my days alternating between taking care of my daughter (we are staying at home due to
                    pandemic) and studying hard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've opted to shift career in <date>2020</date> and I'm currently in my 1st year of code; before
                    that I was working on cultural projects.

                <h3>How I've learned to &lt;code&gt;</h3>
                <p>
                    My development experience comes from courses (mostly free). So I learn from bootcamps, books,
                    documentation and free content I find out there. <br />
                    I'm always seeking to learn more.
